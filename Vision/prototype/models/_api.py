            object is because the specific object might have memory and thus we want to delay initialization until

            informative attributes (for example the number of parameters/flops, recipe link/methods used in training
            etc), configuration parameters (for example the `num_classes`) needed to construct the model or important
            meta-data (for example the `classes` of a classification model) needed to use the model.
